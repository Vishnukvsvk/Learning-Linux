touch - make file
mkdir - make a directory
rmdir - remove directory
mkdir -p tin/hi/op/ki   -   make path of directories
rm - removes file
rm -r tin/hi --> removes path of directories(recursive)
man - gives description of commands


ctrl+C --> SIGINT --> Signal Interrupt
ctrl+Z --> SIGSTP -->  Process suspended,runs in background --> kill -TSTP PID
Resume from background --> fg (no.) --> kill -CONT (PID)

text editors
nano
vim
emacs

ps aux |grep -i /home/totally_not_malicious  --> to get PID of process

mv hi.txt ai.txt (renames)
cat hi.txt (reads hi.txt)


ps aux - (ps=snapshot of processes) Displays all process
ps aux|grep firefox - gives its info
top - task manager(gives running processs, frre ram etc)
htop (same like top with different ui)
PID - each process have process id's
kill -l --> gives all terminating commands
kill 2354 -->(kills 2354 process(2354=process id))
renice -n pid --> (-20 to 20 = priority) (threads concept)
pid =1=root or systemd
every process has parent process, if parents process gets killed, it goes to root process

File systems
man hier - gives all file systems
/etc - config files
/bin - contains all commnads
ssh - secure shell(protocal, to connect to remote server)
/proc - virtual file system (contains details of all process)
/usr - conatains bin,games etc
/home - home
/root - root folder
/boot - files required for booting
/var - contains log - important
/lib64 - libraries
/tmp - contains temporary files, files on download process etc
/sbin - donot change it

Above folders are found in ls /

in sudo -i(root access):-
cat /etc/passwd or cat /etc/shadow gives all accounts in system
I have 41 accounts
Accounts=Root,User=vishnu, service accounts like games,man, other services that are connected to databases
We can create a test account also:

useradd -m -d /home/sankar -u (userid) -g (gropid) -s /bin/bash  sankar
-->(-m=home -d=directory -s=shell,(userid,groupid) are optional)

after adding, u can check by [tail /etc/passwd]

for setting password:passwd sankar
usermod -L sankar(Locks the account)
usermod -U sankar(removes lock)
userdel sankar [--> removes user] but it is present in /home[but doesnt function]
rm -rf /home/sankar [removes sankar from home directory]

rwx[read-write-execute] -->owners
r-x[read - execute] --> owner group

7 = rwx
6=rw
4 = r
0=no permissions

ex = 777 (owner-group-everyone else)
chmod 640 newfile

dr=directory
l=links

blocks and character device files
ls -l /dev
ls -l /dev |grep sd
gives sd info[blocks]

Two applications in linux can interact with each other with sockets
ctrl + D --> exit root user

crontab --> for scheduling tasks
crontab -l -->lists a crontab
crontab -e -->creates a crontab
At bottom,write your task

#m h dom mon dow   command
15 10 *  *  3-5   echo "hi there">hi.txt

m=minute
h=hour
dom=day of month
mon=month of year
dow=day of week

ls /etc/cron.d

tmux-->terminal multiplexer
every command in tmux starts with ctrl+b 
like : ctrl +b c  -->creates a new window

p --> previous window
n --> next window
& --> kill window
% --> split vertically
o --> to switch into different pane in same window
x --> kill pane

Sessions: -->terminals which act as backup sessions
tmux new -s backupssesions

U can run a task and detach from session and work on other tasks. But the session runs on background.
ctrl+b d --> to detach sessinons
tmux ls -->gives list
tmux attach -t backupsessions

we can even share sessions using attch -t sessionname

Archiving and Compressing
Simply zip=Archiving
Find patterns and compress=Compressing  --> Using math algorithms

tar does both archieving and compressing

tar -zcvf docs.tar.gz Documents/      [z=zip , c=create , v=verbose(not used in remote access), f=file name]
ls --> to see above file
Move it in another folder and dezip it
tar -zxf docs.tar.gz         [x=extract]
