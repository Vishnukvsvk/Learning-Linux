list is mutable datatype and tuple is immutable datatype

x=[1,2,3,4,5]

x[1]=2
x[-1]=5
x[1:]=[2,3,4,5]
x[-2:]=[4,5]
x[::1]=[1,2,3,4,5]  --> jump
x[::2]=[1,3,5] --> jump twice
x[::-1]=[5,4,3,2,1]

arr=[["vimal",1111],["daga",2222]]
arr[0]=["vimal",1111]
arr[0][1]=1111

I/O and pipes

when we run a command , we get output in terminal. Why not it displays anywhere else(like other VT's, whatsapp)

Terminal is a device
tty --> provides device name
tty = terminal device

chvt 3 --> goes to VT3
tty --> /dev/tty3
if we go to VT 1 and type --:- date > /dev/tty3, it outputs in tty3 device
No need of login to VT is required

> --> output direction
date > hi.txt
cat hi.txt --> [contains date]

cat > hip.txt
hi buddy 
by
press ctrl+D to save
cat hip.txt to view the file

> file.txt  --> creates file

tr command [translate] = tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'  ===> (convets small to capital)

< means input redirection
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < hi.txt

duty of cat command = cat needs input. It takes input and displays it
cat < hi.txt --> it recievs data from file and prints it.


Every software is bunch of files. It is also called as package.
When we install a software, it copies(or extracts) all files to our hardrive
OS is bunch of lots of hardwares.

In windows, we install all the software at our desired location.
In linux , the files are distibuted in various folders.
Every os has their own file management system

linux package management = rpm
rpm -q firefox ==> (q=query, if software is present, it returns name and version)
rpm -q -a --> lists all software

which python3 --> /usr/bin/python3
rpm -q -f /usr/bin/python3
gives software and its version

rpm -e firefox --> erase or uninstall

To install software with rpm, we shoul go to packages folder and 
rpm -i (firefox....) --> press tab to autocomplete and press enter

-v = verbose mode --> to find what is going on ehile installing software
-h = gives percentage installation bar
rpm -q -l firefox --> gives in which folders, the software files are installed in os

to open image files we use --> eog /path/file.png

If two images in downloads folder.
cat.jpg  dog.jpg
cp cat.jpg dog.jpg  --> copies(replace) dog.jpg with cat.jpg


x=[["hi",333,"ji"],["pi","ki",009],[11,222,"oiu"]]
import numpy as np
a=np.array(x)
a[: ,1] --> gives [333,"ki",222]

cal 
prints calendar
To know its correcrt, 
type echo $? ---> Output:0 means correct

I/O redirection

If command is success, it sends output to std:out(screen) using channel 1
so if date > f.txt, output gets from channel 1 is send to f.txt
date > f.txt == date 1> f.txt

If command is failure, it goes through channel 2(default channel) 
so, if xyz > f1.txt, output displays through screen
if xyz 2> f1.txt, output(i.e., error data) goes to f1.txt
We can see it by cat f1.txt

shell contains channels.

STDIN  -- 0
STDOUT -- 1
STDERR -- 2

date &> f2.txt
xyz &>> f2.txt

& redirects any data to file. It combines channels
