Enter = \n = EOL =End of Line in linux
ctrl + D --> end of file

wc -l -w -c ===> l=lines,w=words,c=characters

ls -l gives extra info
line starts with d if its directory
ls -l | grep ^d  -> gives all directories

grep -n linux f1.txt  --> gives line that contains linux in file
grep -v linux f1.txt  --> gives line that doesn't contains linux in file

date | tee f1.txt  --> prints on screen and file
date | tee | wc -w
date | tee file.txt | wc -w

command --> tee --> stdout & file (only)

cat spider.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
sort--> alphabetically
uniq c --> counts no of words and appends that number in front
sort -nr --> sort acc to num in reverse order
head --> 1st ten lines display

free -> gives free memory
uptime -> log in minutes

echo "`date`" == echo "$(date)"

basename "file.html" ".html"  --> returns "file" as output

Code to change extension

#!/usr/bin/bash

for file in *.HTM; do
  name=$(basename "$file" .HTM)
  echo mv "$file" "$name.html"  --> if its act correct, remove echo   
done


If u want to run a remote command from ur laptop, we need ssh protocol

Connecting two vms in virtual box
Host-only mode --> connect but no internet access
Vridging adapter --> connect with internet supply but needs a hub(mobile hotspot)

If conneted,
ssh (ip of other system) mkdir boxx  --> It gets created in other system

RAM + CPU = Compute unit
HDD = Storage unit

ssh is used to acces compute unit of remote system


ssh vishnu@192.168.43.55 date --> rum command in remote system
scp my.py root@192.168.43.54:/root  --> upload file to remote system
scp root@192.168.43.54:/root/hi.txt  /Desktop/  --> Download file from remote host to localhost
scp -r root@192.168.43.54:/root/fold1  /Desktop/  --> Download folder from remote host to localhost

ssh only works if output is in text format like date,cal etc
ssh root@102.168.43.54 firefox --> doesnt work for graphical output
ssh -X root@102.168.43.54 firefox --> works fine

To change password
ssh -t userName@server.ip.address.here passwd

In ubuntu,
go to root --> sudo -i
passwd user

rpm only installs softawre, but doesnt download it.
Instead we use yum command to download and install softawres.
yum install firefox
yum remove firefox

gpgcheck=0 // for disabling checking
gpgcheck=1 // to enable check while installing software

cd /etc/yum.repos.d/  --> create vishnu.repo and add baseurls

yum repolist --> to check if its completely configured
yum list python2 --> lists if python2 software is present in repolist(i.e baseurls that we have given)
If present we can install.

dnf is upgrade version of yum introduced in redhat8

When baseurl is http url and is invalid, yum takes alot of time to close but dnf doesnt
epel-release software automatically adds internet url and configures yum
wget --> to install software from url
rpm fusion , another softaere like epel.

dnf repolist after installing epel
wde get all softwares in epel (Extra packages for enterprise linux)

There are three timestamps in linux
atime (access time) - The last time the file was accessed/opened by some command or application such as cat.
mtime (modify time) - The last time the file’s content was modified.
ctime (change time) - The last time the file’s attribute or content was changed. The attribute includes file permissions, file ownership or file location.

To display the file status including the timestamps, use the stat command.
stat ai.txt

touch -m ai.txt  --> changes modify time to current time
touch -a ai.txt  --> changes access time to current time
touch -c ai.txt  --> changes all times to current time
