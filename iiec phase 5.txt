dnf intall httpd
service httpd start
service httpd status

cd /var/www/html
U can create html pages in this folder

Redhat has inbuilt firewall, so we cant run the server
systemctl stop firewalld  --> this command stops firewall temporarily,for that session
systemctl disable firewalld  --> stops firewall permanently

curl --> client url --> command to access any url
curl is command line browser

In one OS, we can create multiple servers
port number is unique identification of serivice
ssh-22, dns-53, mail-25 etc

netstat -tnlp --> gives all services with port numbers
standard port : http : 80 for a webserver
But, we can assign any port number for our server, to do that we have to configure our web server.
cd /etc/httpd/conf
gedit httpd.conf --> and chanege port number
port number range : 2 bytes = 2^16 --> 0 to 65536


Whenevr u change anything in conf file, u have to restart the proccess.
service httpd stop || systemctl stop httpd
service httpd start

web client --> Browser

daemon are programs that u dont need to login to access them.
Examples are web servers.

SELinux --> security enhanced linux
It is the biggest secutity for os in the world

httpd service only accepts 80 and 81 due to SELinux
For using other ports,we need to disable SELinux

To disable SELinux,
setenforce 0
To enable it again.
setenforce 1

We cant give one port to multiple programs but we can give one program to multipe ports

### nmap is illegal, use it to your own server
nmap -sP 192.168.43.1-255
gives which host are up

nmap -sT 192.168.43.54
gives all protocols of that server.

To get detailed report of the port of server, we type
nmap -sT -p 1111(port number) -sV 192.168.43.54
It gives, what service protocol, which software and version u r using

Always change in /etc/httpd/conf.d location.
Create a .conf file and set priorities
Priorities are always given to secondary config file
