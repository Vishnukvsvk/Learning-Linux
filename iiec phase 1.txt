To run a process in linux, typr the process name
Ex- to open firefox, type firefox and press enter.

which firefox -- Gives where firefox is installed -- /usr/bin/firefox
Every process is a program or a script

gedit -- notepad of linux
gedit /usr/bin/firefox  -- opens firefox script which is written in bash
We can even change it and get own custom firefox also.

commnads
-->date
-->cal = gives calendar of month
-->cal 2020 = gives calendar of whole year
-->cal 10 2020 = oct 2020 cal

in cal 1752 --> 11 days are misiing?

-->speak command = espeak-ng hello  --> in redhat 8
-->date | espeak-ng

watch date --> refreshes date every 2 sec, keeps on displaying
watch -n 1 date --> fo every 1 sec

ctrl+c = terminate program
ctrl+z = pause the program and puts in background

ping goo.gl = sends icmp packets ontinuosly
ctrl+z = pauses it and puts it in background
jobs = prints all processes paused in background
fg (id) = brings it to foreground and resumes


(process)  & --> puts task in background and runs it.
firefox  & --> It runs firefox, we can use the browser and also terminal is available.

whatever you wite in back quote, it treats as command.
echo "date" --> date
echo "`date`" --> 2 -04 -20202
echo -n "hello" --> prints hello beside --> no new line

echo -e "hello\nhi" --> -e enables escape sequence
hello
hi

echo -e "hello\thi" --> -e enables escape sequence
hello	hi

\b --> backspace
echo -e "hello\bhi" --> hellhi
echo -e "hello\b"   --> hello --> Because after hello it goes to newline.
echo -e -n "hello\b" --> hell [root]:

man --> manual

gedit mywork

In it, write all commands u want
ex-

date
cal
cal 1752
date +%d

-- and then save file

Now bash mywork --> this runs the file content as commads and executes all commands in it

livedate
while:
do
echo -n -e "`date +%T``sleep 1`\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b"
done &

or

while: ; do echo -n -e "`date +%T``sleep 1`\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" ;done &

ifconfig
--> displays all network cards
first card = main card = enp0s3 = ethernet cards

Any address which can be stored within 4 bytes is valid ip address
But __.__.__.__ format is highly use

bc = calculator

google ip address
172.217.163.196

convert it into octet -> 172*(2^24)+217*(2^16)+163*(2^8)+196*(2^0) = 2899944388
ping 2899944388 means pinging google.

Therfore , 2899944388 is valid ip.
Advantage : if u block an ip address, they create a firewall for ipv4 format. But u can access the server by converting ipv4 to one octet. Its a hack.

There are some proxy that only allows certain ip address, here we can used the hack
