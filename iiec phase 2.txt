new terminal :-- gnome-terminal

we use bash scripting in linux

RAM -- Memory -- temporary
HDD -- Storage -- Data stored is permanent

ps -aux --> to find all process in ram
ps -aux | grep firefox --> fetches firefox with PID
kill PID  --> Useful to close multiple terminal windows(example) etc

New user -- useradd jack
setting password -- passwd jack  (and set it)
id jack --> to view user details

find current user --> whoami

console - virtual terminal
redhat provides 6 of them
To switch VT, we use ctrl+alt+(f1,f2,f3...)  or chnvt (1,2,3,4,5,6)[(not sure)But doesnt work in sudo terminal]
f1,,f2 --> gui
f3,f4,f5,f6 --> cli based

cli based consoles doesnt support mouse interaction.
To enable, we have to intall gpm(General Purpose Mouse)

startx --> command to convert cli to gui
check terminal --> tty command

To increase no of VT's, we go to etc/systemd/logind.conf and chane NautoVTs

***********************
Shell is a program which processes commands and returns output , like bash in Linux . Terminal is a program that run a shell.

The main difference between kernel and shell is that the kernel is the core of the operating system that controls all the tasks of the system while the shell is the interface that allows the users to communicate with the kernel.

username@computername:~$ _
is actually a program which facilitates you with invoking a "SHELL" prompt.
************************

Hackers want shell, But to open shell, they want to pass authentication.

-->gnome {user and GUI}
-->shell {user and CLI}
-->kernel{hardware and software}

echo $USER --> USER is a variable == whoami

tput setaf (1|2|...|7) - to change shell color
