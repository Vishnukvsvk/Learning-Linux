For connecting two machines ,we require

1.OS
2.Network card
3.IPv4
4. Ip of A and IP of B should be in same network
5.Physical connectivity(wireless or wire)

Network name --> initial 3 octets of 4 in ipv4.[(192.168.54).43] 

If network names are same --. to connect, we can use direct coaxial cable,switch,hub,bridge etc
If networks names are different,
192.168.1.1 && 192.168.2.5 --> Only router can establish connection

Above is old
To get netwok name --> comapre with netmask
if netmask = 255.255.255.0 , then first 3 octets is your network name

Mathematically
To get netwok name,convert ip and netmask to binary and do & operation to every digit.

CIDR format can also give netmask
255.0.0.0    --> /8
255.255.0.0  --> /16 

Mobile hotspot --> switch

Router has 2 sides --> one side it has ip addres of same network name of LAN
                   --> other side, it has ip address of same network name of Google(or other)

Hotspot works as switch and router also.

route -n --> gives gateway ip
0.0.0.0 --> to connect to any ip in the world = special ip
route del -net 0.0.0.0 --> removes entry in route table

We can configure betwork of system manually
That means we can give our own ip,net mask et c
ifconfig enp0s3 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.0.0  --> manual config

Or we set network config automatically using DHCP(Dynamic host configuration) server

DHCP contains IPAM(IP Address Management)

SDN = Software Define Network --> Can create switch functionality using software
Bridge = switch+router --> software=SDN
